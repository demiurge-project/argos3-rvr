What is ARGoS-RVR?
------------------

ARGoS-RVR is a plugin that enables the use of the RVR robot in ARGoS. ARGoS-RVR contains
the software modules for both the physical robot and its simulated version. Therefore, the
user can develop a control software for the RVR and test it in a virtual environment and then port
the same control software, without modifications, on the real RVR. In order to be used on the
real RVR, the plugin requires the robots to be equipped with a Raspberry Pi as microcontroller.
